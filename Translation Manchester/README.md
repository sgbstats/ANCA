**Introduction**:Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitides are multiorgan autoimmune disorders. Renal involvement is very common and disease presentation heterogeneous. Reliable prediction tools are needed to improve prognostication and personalisation of treatment.

**Aims**: To validate and update the Renal Risk Score (RRS) [1] and explore other factors of renal survival in the largest cohort ever assembled.

**Methods**: We investigated a retrospective multicentre international longitudinal cohort from referral centres and registries. Patients included had a biopsy proven ANCA glomerulonephritis (GN). The primary endpoint was end stage kidney disease (ESKD). Patients were censored at last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier estimates and Harrellâ€™s C were used to assess model performance. Cox Proportion Hazards was used to reweigh risk factors and develop a modified scoring system.

**Results**: Of a total of 1591 patients, 1439 were included in the final analyses (959 in the development cohort, 52% male, median age 64 years). The RRS demonstrated a discrimination of C=0.800, comparable to the original cohort. Reweighing, we found an additional cut-off for kidney function. We further replaced glomerular filtration rate with serum creatinine which provided a higher reliability. We modified the score creating four risk groups with an additional continuous model to supply risk percentage and group (C=0.831 and C=0.833).

**Conclusion**: We demonstrated the out-of-sample validity of the RRS and propose a modification of the score to optimise prognostication and risk stratification for treatment and clinical trials.

**Future Work**: Currently, we are developing a treatment pathway for ANCA GN based on calibrated risk versus reward.
